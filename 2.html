This visit was to determine a large part of his career. One of the consequences of his trip was the honourable invitation to conduct the Great Russian State Choir Alexander Yurlov Capella as part of the 1990 Tchaikovsky Memorial Year (Tchaikovsky had been born 150 years earlier). The collaboration between choir and conductor was later followed by a successful concert tour through the Netherlands. Guest performances with the St. Petersburg Symphony Orchestra – together with the legendary pianist Tatyana Nicolaeva in a performance of Tchaikovsky’s Second Piano Concerto was another consequence of his performances in Russia.</h5> </div>
